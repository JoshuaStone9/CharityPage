        <h1>Our Journey</h1>
        <p class="ourjourneyText">I was inspired to support this charity after witnessing the challenges faced by 
          loved ones battling stage 4 cancer. Their strength and resilience motivated 
          me to take action and contribute to a cause that provides essential support 
          to those in need. Through this initiative, I hope to make a meaningful difference 
          in the lives of patients and their families, offering them hope and assistance 
          during difficult times.</p>
